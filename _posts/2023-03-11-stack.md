The first place I've encountered the concept of LIFO/LILO is...

Homestuck's Sylladex.
Thank you very much.

If you had ever tried problem solving, you'd know they are important.

At very least, `Queue` for BFS.
I've once used `Stack` with `struct` for implementing undo function too.

Like, I used both of them literally in the [last post][LastPost].


# Stack

LIFO, or Last In First Out.

To be perfectly honest, the names for `Stack` and `Queue` perfectly
describe themselves on how they should function so well that
I don't have to talk more about.

But for the reference, here's the code in `C`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h> // contains limits for var types

#define ERROR_ARGUMENT_NULL INT_MIN
#define ERROR_OUT_OF_INDEX INT_MAX
#define MAX_SIZE 10

// Function Declaration

int Push(int* const _pStack, int* const _pIndex, int const _value);
int Pop(int* const _pStack, int* const _pIndex);
int Peek(int* const _pStack, int const _pIndex);
```

Unlike `C#`, you cannot put functions anywhere in `C` and `C++`.
However, you can put function declarations first and definition later.
(Like `C#`'s `delegate`)

The names of parameters can also be skipped but
they help readability for later.

```c
/// Function Definition

int Push(int* const _pStack, int* const _pIndex, int const _value) {
	if (_pStack == NULL || _pIndex == NULL) return ERROR_ARGUMENT_NULL;

	if (*_pIndex >= MAX_SIZE) return ERROR_OUT_OF_INDEX;
	_pStack[*_pIndex] = _value;
	++(*_pIndex);
	return 0;
}

int Pop(int* const _pStack, int* const _pIndex) {
	if (_pStack == NULL || _pIndex == NULL) return ERROR_ARGUMENT_NULL;
	if (*_pIndex <= 0) return ERROR_OUT_OF_INDEX;

	return _pStack[--(*_pIndex)];
}

int Peek(int* const _pStack, int const _pIndex) {
	if (_pStack == NULL || _pIndex == NULL) return ERROR_ARGUMENT_NULL;
	if (_pIndex <= 0) return ERROR_OUT_OF_INDEX;

	return _pStack[_pIndex - 1];
}
```

And `Push`, `Pop`, and `Peek`.

I wonder if calculating array size inside function is possible.

```c
int main() {
	int stack[MAX_SIZE] = { 0 };
	int index = 0;

	Push(stack, &index, 1);
	Push(stack, &index, 2);
	Push(stack, &index, 3);
	Push(stack, &index, 4);
	printf("Pop : %d\n", Pop(stack, &index));
	printf("Pop : %d\n", Pop(stack, &index));
	printf("Peek: %d\n", Peek(stack, index));
	printf("Pop : %d\n", Pop(stack, &index));
	printf("Pop : %d\n", Pop(stack, &index));

	return 0;
}
```

And the `main`.

This returns following:

```
Pop : 4
Pop : 3
Peek: 2
Pop : 2
Pop : 1

```

# Pre operators

I forgot to write this in previous posts but
it is worth noting that pre-in/decrement operators are
faster than post counterparts.

```c
int i = 0, N = 5;
for (; i < N; i++) // instead of this
for (; i < N; ++i) // use this!
```

Let's not forget to check when this switch is plausible
and when it is not.

Like, when you are actually reading it.

```c
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) printf("%d\t", i++);
// switching this to ++i would print from 1 instead of 0
```
