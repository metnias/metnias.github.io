Queue!

While the last post's [Stack][PostStack] is
used for implementing undo functions,
Queue is used for BFS, or in game design, following NPC.


# Queue

LILO, or FIFO.

The class started by linear queue, which meant its
`Get` function would be `O(n)`.

That was not worth it, so I just went ahead and wrote circular one.

Which was a good idea as the instructor demanded us to write that
and now I got free time to write this post.

Here's the code in `C`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ARR_LEN 5
int queue[ARR_LEN] = { 0 };
int idxTail = 0;
int idxHead = 0;
int count = 0;

// Enqueue
int Put(int _data);
// Dequeue
int Get(void);
int Print(void);
```

This time, we use global variables for our data.

Which means I don't need that much parameters for `Put` and `Get`. 


### Put, a.k.a. Enqueue

```c
int Put(int _data) {
    if (count >= ARR_LEN) {
        printf("Overflow!\n");
        return -1;
    }
    queue[idxTail] = _data;
    idxTail = (idxTail + 1) % ARR_LEN;
    ++count;

    return 0;
}
```

I had extra `count` variable to keep track of how many items are queued...
in the queue. `count` is used a lot handling actual Queue, so I think
this extra 4B is worth to spend rather than calculating that.


### Print

Does `C#` has this? `string.Join(' ', myQueue)`?

```c
int Print(void) {
    int i = idxHead;
    for (int c = count; c > 0; --c) {
        printf("%d - ", queue[i]);
        i = (i + 1) % ARR_LEN;
    }
    printf("(%d)\n", count);

    return 0;
}
```

I decided to not throw an error when the count is 0.

If the count is zero, just display that it is zero.

The original method I used for this was much complicated one
with 2 ifs, 3 fors and one subfunction, but after adding `count`,
this method got much simplified as well.


### Get, a.k.a. Dequeue

```c
int Get(void) {
    if (count <= 0) {
        printf("Empty!\n");
        return -1;
    }
    int r = queue[idxHead++];
    idxHead = (idxHead + 1) % ARR_LEN;
    --count;

    return r;
}
```

And the getter now mirrors the setter, unlike linear queue.
Thus, `O(1)` as how Queue should be.
